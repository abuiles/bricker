##
# Makes a simple traversal that is used by the basic suggester.
# It starts at a user node and visits all liked nodes. From there
# it continues to traverse through "actings" and "directings" 
# connections to find movies and people that are related to the 
# movies and people the user already likes.
# 
# It returns a hash with the ids of the related nodes as keys. 
# The values contain the amount of paths this node can be reached
# through this traversal from the user (i.e. how important is this
# related node).
